# Stereo 📻

Curate and play music in your browser. No account, login or subscription required!

# How to use

All you need is [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

Launch Stereo from the command-line:

```
uvx git+https://github.com/buntec/stereo
```

Navigate to `localhost:8005` in your browser.

Begin by searching for and adding music to a collection.
You can create as many collections as you want.
A collection is just a file on your local hard disk.
More precisely, it's a SQLite database containing track meta data only - no actual audio data is stored or downloaded!

For the best possible playback experience, a YouTube Premium subscription or a good ad-blocker is highly recommended.

Work in progress! 🚧
